# Manual Browser Setup Guide

## ðŸŽ¯ **Solution: Use Your Own Browser Session**

Since the casino website blocks automated access, the best approach is to use your own browser session that you manually log into.

### **Step 1: Manual Browser Setup**

1. **Open Chrome manually** and navigate to:
   ```
   https://www.seguro.bet.br/slots/all/320/evolution/66120-2170889-immersive-roulette
   ```

2. **Log in to your casino account** manually

3. **Navigate to the Immersive Roulette table**

4. **Keep the browser window open** and visible

### **Step 2: Run the Collector**

1. **Open a new terminal/command prompt**

2. **Navigate to the project folder:**
   ```bash
   cd G:\Projects\upwork\caseno
   ```

3. **Run the manual collector:**
   ```bash
   python manual_collector.py
   ```

### **Step 3: How It Works**

- The collector will connect to your existing Chrome browser
- It will monitor the page you already have open
- When roulette results appear, it will capture them instantly
- Results will be sent to Discord and your local HTML system

### **Step 4: Benefits**

âœ… **No Cloudflare blocking** - Uses your authenticated session  
âœ… **Real-time detection** - Captures results as they appear  
âœ… **Reliable operation** - No anti-bot detection  
âœ… **Full functionality** - All features work perfectly  

### **Step 5: Usage**

1. **Start your browser session** (log in manually)
2. **Run the collector** in a separate terminal
3. **Keep both running** - the collector will monitor your browser
4. **Results will be captured** and sent automatically

This approach bypasses all anti-bot protections while maintaining full functionality!
